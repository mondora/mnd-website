                            mondora is a self-organized company with a flat structure. This means that everyone is on the same level, including the CEO. Only the customer is above, as the company has a “customer centered” work approach in which customer happiness is key. Self-organization implies that every employee within the company takes responsibility for his or her own work. There are no managers, only “team players”. Each person, or player, agrees on work with his/her team, makes autonomous decisions and consults colleagues for complex issues.

                            Most work within mondora is done in teams. Teams work together to create solutions and solve issues. Within a team, junior members can learn from more senior ones. Often team members work in pairs, either in the office or remotely. This is a great way for people to acquire new skills and see how others work. One important aspect of this organization is that teams are not fixed for the whole duration of a project. Team rotation is encouraged and all players are expected to take part in different projects and learn to use various technologies during their time in mondora.
